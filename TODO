## TODO

* detect water/land regions
* detect litorals
* detect interior water tiles
* detect litoral tiles

## IDEAS

* use generated textures of plate-shaped forms to create plates
    * generate random equidistant points
    * put texture on top and get edge points in intersections, depending of what plate was chosen to be on top
    * intersections can have many sizes, so use them as uplift points or similar
    * use setInterval to continue generating random shapes
